🔥 Problem We Solved

Initially the website could calculate GPA, but all data disappeared after refresh —
which meant users had to enter everything again.

❗ Challenge

No backend = No saving system
Refresh = All grades erased

🌟 Solution

We integrated LocalStorage in JavaScript, allowing the browser to permanently retain GPA data until manually cleared — meaning students can close the site, return later, and their grades are still there.

📚 Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened not just coding skills — but teamwork, logic, and real application design.

Mastered HTML, CSS & JS fundamentals

Implemented real numeric computation formulas

Created responsive layouts for multi-device usage

Learned browser data management using LocalStorage

Improved debugging, UI planning & problem-solving

Gained version control experience (GitHub Collaboration)

🏆 Challenges Faced & Overcome
Challenge	What Happened	Final Fix
Data disappeared on refresh	No backend/data retention	Implemented JavaScript localStorage
Responsive layout breaking	Elements overlapped on mobile	Rebuilt flex/grid + media queries
GPA calculation showing errors	Parsing issues & invalid entries	Input validation + error handling
UI felt too simple	Needed better user journey	Improved typography, spacing & icons
